## Context
A Java demo project to learn how to interact with SQL Database using JDBC.

## Notes
You can reproduce the exercise without having an "actual" SQL Database. You can just use the docker-compose.yaml file to up a data base (please note the port to connect using a DB manager such as MySQL Workbench or DBeaver).
